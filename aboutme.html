    <h1>Eric Moyer</h1>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>I was born in Hershey, Pennsylvania on the 28th of January, 2000. I grew up in the small
      and rather unknown town of Quarryville, near the southern end of Pennsylviana, in Lancaster county.
      I first touched a computer at around the age of 6 or 7, and have been interested in them ever since then.</p>
    <h2>Interests</h2>
    <p>My interests have been varied over the years, and might change as time
      goes on.</p>
