  <p>As I said before, I'm Eric Moyer.</p>
  <p>A programming and fighting game adept.</p>
  <p>I've been playing video games since I could hold a controller, and been
  using a computer since I was probably 6 or 7. I've always wanted to get into
programming, but never delved deep enough to find help on it. Until now of course,
where I want it to be my job.</p>
