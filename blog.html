    <h5>Magic: The Gathering: The state of Commander, 9/30/19</h5>

    <p>Commander, as wide open a format as it is, faces down the problems of
      not having seperate banlists for casual and competitive EDH.
      This problem rears its ugly head when brewing, as certain cards are banned
      for being "unfun" or "broken" when they're only unfun or broken in casual.
      Problem is, most follow the official banlist made by Wizards of the Coast themselves.
      Which is made by a committee, who focus on the normal playstyle of EDH, which is referred
      to as "casual".</p>
    <p>This leads to a divide in the player base of commander. Some competitive pods
      run house rules on what is banned and what is not, which might not mesh with
      the local game store's rulings. This divide does more harm than good, and
      leads to malice between the two player bases, with the CEDH crowd blaming
      casuals for certain cards and combos being banned, E.G: Paradox Engine, a
      card highly malined for it's ability to make turns go on forever with the right setup.
      Banned by the committee for making casual games too long. While in CEDH, Engine was used
      as a straight up game plan for some decks, since it was an artifact, letting it easily
      slot into any deck. It has thus been seplanted by Isochron Scepter and Dramatic Reversal, allowing
      a similar effect to happen, but only available to commanders with Blue in their color identity.</p>
    <p>I personally believe the banlist should have another look over, and the lists to be seperated.
      Commander 1v1/Duel Commander each have their own seperate banlists, so why can't competitive EDH?
      However this also leads to a deeper rooted problem of what exactly is the barrier between CEDH and normal
      EDH power level wise. A very subjective topic, seeing as "competitiveness" is hard to measure in a deck.</p>
